        I am a Computer Science from McMaster University who graduated on June 2023. I'm passionate about web development, with hands-on experience in React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and NodeJS. I'm eager to begin my career and am open to roles in front-end, 
        back-end, or full-stack development. I am constantly looking to challenge myself by learning new skills, and expanding my knowledge in web development. I am eager to show my current skills and knowledge to any work/projects I do. Creating sleek, 
        user-friendly websites with highly functional, efficient, and robust backends is what drives my passion and motivation as a web developer. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, learning to speak new languages, and baking.
