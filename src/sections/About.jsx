        Hi! I'm Paul. I grew up in Sarnia, Ontario. In school, I gravitated towards math, and spent a lot of my free time on the computer. I quickly learned how much I adored computers, and learned everything I could about them. In high school, I tried programming for the first
        time, along with basic HTML, which is when I seriously considered becoming a programmer, so I applied to McMaster University for a Computer Science major in 2018. During my first year in university, I took a programming class, and the satisfaction and joy I felt from creating my first program was when I knew I picked the right career path. From then
        on, my passion and love for creating things through programming has stayed strong. I studied Computer Science for 5 years and graduated in June 2023. I'm currently based in Ontario, Canada. I'm passionate about web development, with hands-on experience in React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and NodeJS. 
        I'm eager to begin my career and am open to roles in front-end, 
        back-end, or full-stack development. I am constantly looking to challenge myself by learning new skills, expanding my knowledge in web development, and applying my current skills and knowledge to any work/projects I do. Creating sleek, 
        user-friendly websites with highly functional, efficient, and robust backends, along with being able to build and see projects I participate in slowly come to life drives my passion and motivation as a web developer.
        <br />
        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, learning to speak new languages such as Korean and Japanese, and baking sweets!
